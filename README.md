# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird game for final project in ICS3U0

Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by the Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen, under his game development company .Gears. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. 

The game that I have created is an adaptation of flappy bird, to increase my understanding of game development and coding theories and capabilites.

#The keybinds for this game are as follows:

"SPACE" or "LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON" to jump.

There are music and sound effects added please turn on  the volume to hear them.
